*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************
                                                                    conditionals Statements
1. Using if Statement
The if statement is used to evaluate a particular condition. If the condition holds true, the associated code block is executed.

Syntax:

if ( condition ) {
    // If the condition is met, 
    //code  will get executed.
}
example-
let num = 20;

if (num % 2 === 0) {
    console.log("Given number is even number.");
}

if (num % 2 !== 0) {
    console.log("Given number is odd number.");
};

2. Using if-else Statement
The if-else statement will perform some action for a specific condition. Here we are using the else statement in which the else statement is written after the if statement and it has no condition in their code block.

Syntax:

if (condition1) {
    // Executes when condition1 is true
    if (condition2) {
        // Executes when condition2 is true
    }
}
example- 
let age = 25;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are eligible of driving licence")
} else {
    console.log("You are not eligible for driving licence")
};

3. else if Statement
The else if statement in JavaScript allows handling multiple possible conditions and outputs, evaluating more than two options based on whether the conditions are true or false.

Syntax:

if (1st condition) {
    // Code for 1st condition
} else if (2nd condition) {
    // ode for 2nd condition
} else if (3rd condition) {
    // Code for 3rd condition
} else {
    //  ode that will execute if all 
    // above conditions are false
}
example- 
const num = 0;

if (num > 0) {
    console.log("Given number is positive.");
} else if (num < 0) {
    console.log("Given number is negative.");
} else {
    console.log("Given number is zero.");
};

4. Using Switch Statement (JavaScript Switch Case)
As the number of conditions increases, you can use multiple else-if statements in JavaScript. but when we dealing with many conditions, the switch statement may be a more preferred option.

Syntax:

switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        statement1;
        break;
    case value2:
        statement2;
        break;
    . . .
    case valueN:
        statementN;
        break;
    default:
        statementDefault;
};
example-
const marks = 85;

let Branch;

switch (true) {
    case marks >= 90:
        Branch = "Computer science engineering";
        break;
    case marks >= 80:
        Branch = "Mechanical engineering";
        break;
    case marks >= 70:
        Branch = "Chemical engineering";
        break;
    case marks >= 60:
        Branch = "Electronics and communication";
        break;
    case marks >= 50:
        Branch = "Civil engineering";
        break;
    default:
        Branch = "Bio technology";
        break;
}

console.log(`Student Branch name is : ${Branch}`);

5. Using Ternary Operator ( ?: )
The conditional operator, also referred to as the ternary operator (?:), is a shortcut for expressing conditional statements in JavaScript.

Syntax:

condition ? value if true : value if false
example- 
let age = 21;

const result =
    (age >= 18) ? "You are eligible to vote."
        : "You are not eligible to vote.";

console.log(result);

6. Nested if…else
Nested if…else statements in JavaScript allow us to create complex conditional logic by checking multiple conditions in a hierarchical manner. Each if statement can have an associated else block, and within each if or else block, you can nest another if…else statement. This nesting can continue to multiple levels, but it’s important to maintain readability and avoid excessive complexity.

Syntax:
if (condition1) {
    // Code block 1
    if (condition2) {
        // Code block 2
    } else {
        // Code block 3
    }
} else {
    // Code block 4
}
example- 
let weather = "sunny";
let temperature = 25;

if (weather === "sunny") {
    if (temperature > 30) {
        console.log("It's a hot day!");
    } else if (temperature > 20) {
        console.log("It's a warm day.");
    } else {
        console.log("It's a bit cool today.");
    }
} else if (weather === "rainy") {
    console.log("Don't forget your umbrella!");
} else {
    console.log("Check the weather forecast!");
};
